### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, My name is Mario and i'm a web developer. 
i have been developing for the past 10 years(since i was 14) focusind on Back-End, using Node.js/Python/Golang and PHP. Currently i've been dedicated to Node.js/gRPC microsservices with GoLang/React.js and Vue.js integrations.

 i'm a Linux user for the past 9 years, I prioritize using the best versioning technologies like Git and have skills in Github and Gitlab. I value well-structured, quality code and use agile development methodologies to manage projects

i have experience working with teams from different nationalities, ethnicities and genders, and doing extra activities such as code review for the team.

i've worked in projects such as Sanata Delivery(Node.js/React.js), Legaliza Digital(Node.js/React.js), AgendarEntrega(gRPC microsservices with Golang/React.js), Bidout App (Node.js/Vue.js/MongoDB) 

i have experience with the relational databases MySQL and PostgresSQL and non-relational databases MongoDB.

I'm always up for new challenges and opportunities to continue exploring and learning new technologies.
